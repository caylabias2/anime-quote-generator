# Anime Quote Generator

This project is a dynamic anime quote generator that displays quotes from characters across various anime series. The user selects a character from a list, and the application fetches a random quote for that character from an external API. The background color and image of the container dynamically change based on the character selected.

## Features

- **Anime Series & Characters**: Select from popular anime series like *Naruto*, *Dragon Ball*, *Hunter x Hunter*, *Bleach*, and *One Piece*.
- **Dynamic Character Selection**: After selecting an anime, users can choose from a list of characters to generate a random quote for that character.
- **Styled Containers**: Each anime has its own color scheme and default image that changes when a quote is displayed based on the character selected.
- **API Integration**: Fetches quotes from the **Yurippe API** for the selected character.
